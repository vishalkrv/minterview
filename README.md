Project Overview

In this project, I have used create-react-app to scaffold the application and then I have used material icons for few icons and for rest of the implementation React is used.
For this project, the store has been created used React Context and Hooks for the global state management.
React Context which was introduced recently is a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props.
